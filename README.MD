# Word builder

This is a small web based game in which you need to figure out what the randomly chosen word is by clicking the buttons (the letters). If you figure out what the word is, you will get a message telling you.

## How to play?

You have 2 panels: The letters panel where all the buttons for the letters are and the words panel. This is where your output will appear (everything you typed). You also have the option to delete the last added letter from your wordss panel if you feel you've made the wrong choice.

Enjoy!
